QuickDesk is an **open-source, free** remote desktop application built on Google Chromium Remoting technology, developed entirely in **pure C++**. It is the **first commercial-grade, pure C++ open-source remote desktop software**.

Chromium Remoting is the underlying technology behind Google Chrome Remote Desktop, battle-tested for over a decade at massive scale, serving hundreds of millions of users worldwide with industrial-grade performance, stability, and security. QuickDesk stands on the shoulders of Chromium to deliver a freely deployable, fully data-sovereign remote desktop solution.

## Why QuickDesk?

- **Open-Source & Free**: MIT License, no feature restrictions, no connection limits, commercial use welcome
- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy your own signaling and TURN relay servers, keep full control of your data
- **Commercial-Grade Foundation**: Built on Chromium Remoting — the same technology powering Chrome Remote Desktop, refined by Google for 10+ years and proven by billions of users
- **Pure C++ Ultimate Performance**: Full C++ stack from protocol core to GUI — no GC pauses, no runtime overhead, minimal memory and CPU footprint
- **Modern Codecs**: H.264, VP8, VP9, AV1 — flexibly switch based on network and hardware conditions
- **WebRTC P2P Direct Connection**: Prioritizes peer-to-peer connections for lowest latency; automatically falls back to TURN relay when traversal fails
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows and macOS supported (Linux planned)
- **Modern UI**: Fluent Design interface built with Qt 6 + QML, with light and dark themes

### Why Best-in-Class Performance?

1. **Pure C++ Full Stack**: The entire stack — from low-level protocol to GUI — is implemented in C++. No garbage collection pauses, no VM/runtime overhead. Compared to RustDesk's Dart/Flutter GUI layer or ToDesk's Electron-based approach, CPU and memory usage are significantly lower.

2. **Chromium-Level Optimization**: Core paths for video encoding/decoding, network transmission, and screen capture directly reuse Chromium's highly optimized C++ code, including SIMD instruction optimization and zero-copy rendering pipelines.

3. **Shared Memory Video Transfer**: QuickDesk uses shared memory to pass video frames (YUV I420) between processes, eliminating the serialization/deserialization and data copying overhead of traditional IPC.

4. **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: YUV data is fed directly into the GPU rendering pipeline via Qt 6's `QVideoSink`, achieving zero-CPU-copy video rendering.

## Architecture

QuickDesk uses a modular multi-process architecture:

    end

    GUI -- "Native Messaging\n(stdin/stdout JSON)" --> Client
    Host -- "WebSocket" --> Signaling

    Host -. "WebRTC P2P / TURN Relay" .-> Client
```

## Getting Started

### Download

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/barry-ran/QuickDesk/releases) to download the latest version:

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Windows x64 | [QuickDesk-win-x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/barry-ran/QuickDesk/releases/latest) |
| macOS ARM64 | [QuickDesk-mac-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/barry-ran/QuickDesk/releases/latest) |

### Usage

1. Install and run QuickDesk on both the **host** (remote) and **client** (local) machines
2. The host will automatically generate a **Device ID** and **Access Code**
3. On the client, enter the host's Device ID and Access Code, then click **Connect**
4. You're now remotely controlling the host machine

## Build from Source

### Requirements

- CMake 3.19+
- Qt 6.5+ (Multimedia and WebSockets modules required)
- C++17 compiler

### Windows

```bash
# Requires Visual Studio 2022 + MSVC
# Set Qt path environment variable
set ENV_QT_PATH=C:\Qt\6.8.3

# Build
scripts\build_qd_win.bat Release

# Package (requires Inno Setup)
scripts\publish_qd_win.bat Release
scripts\package_qd_win.bat Release
```

### macOS

```bash
# Requires Xcode Command Line Tools
# Set Qt path environment variable
export ENV_QT_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.8.3

# Build
bash scripts/build_qd_mac.sh Release

# Package
bash scripts/publish_qd_mac.sh Release
bash scripts/package_qd_mac.sh Release
```

### API Key (Optional)

If you deploy your own signaling server with API Key enabled, you can inject the API Key at build time so your clients can authenticate:

```bash
# Windows
set ENV_QUICKDESK_API_KEY=your-secret-key
scripts\build_qd_win.bat Release

# macOS
ENV_QUICKDESK_API_KEY=your-secret-key bash scripts/build_qd_mac.sh Release
```

Without `ENV_QUICKDESK_API_KEY`, the build produces an open-source client that can only connect to signaling servers without API Key protection.

> **WebClient note:** The WebClient is a static web page running in the browser. Since API keys embedded in JavaScript are visible via DevTools, the WebClient uses **Origin whitelist** validation instead of API Key. Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on the signaling server to restrict which domains can access it. Browsers automatically send the `Origin` header and JavaScript cannot forge it, so only the WebClient served from your official domain will be allowed.

See [Signaling Server Deployment](docs/signaling-server-deployment.md) for details.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

QuickDesk supports full self-hosted deployment. You can deploy all services on your own servers to ensure data security.

### Components

1. **Signaling Server** (required): Handles device registration and signaling relay
2. **TURN Relay Server** (recommended): Provides relay when P2P direct connection fails

For a detailed deployment guide, see [Signaling Server Deployment](docs/signaling-server-deployment.md).

### Client Configuration

In QuickDesk **Settings → Network**:
- Signaling server address: `ws://your-server.com:8000` or `wss://your-server.com:8000`
- Custom STUN server: `stun:your-server.com:3478`
- Custom TURN server: `turn:your-server.com:3478` (username and password required)
